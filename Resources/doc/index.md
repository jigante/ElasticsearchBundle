## What is it?

The ElasticsearchBundle uses the [official PHP client for Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/index.html) to allow for easy integration of Elasticsearch into Symfony2 applications.

#### NOTICE
The bundle was originally a fork of the excellent [bundle by ONGR.io](https://github.com/ongr-io/ElasticsearchBundle), however I had a bit different vision about certain things and some additional requirements. Eventually, the codebase was largely refactored to become a separate project, but still sharing a lot of similarities with the original.
